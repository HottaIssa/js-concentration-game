      <h2>Instructions for the Concentration Game</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Welcome to the Concentration Game! This game is designed to test and
        improve your memory and concentration skills. Here's how to play:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ol>
        <li>
          Start the Game: Click on the "INICIAR" button to begin the game. The
          game will generate 100 random numbers and display them on the cards.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Find the Correct Numbers: Your goal is to click on the cards with the
          correct numbers in ascending order. The numbers are generated
          randomly, so you'll need to pay close attention to find the correct
          sequence.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Click on the Cards: Click on the cards to reveal the numbers. If you
          click on a card with a number that matches the current target number,
          the card will turn green for a short time to indicate a correct
          answer. If you click on a card with a number that is lower than the
          current target number, the card will turn red for a short time to
          indicate an incorrect answer.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Progress through the Game: As you progress through the game, the
          target number will increase. Keep clicking on the cards to reveal the
          correct numbers and advance through the game.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Complete the Game: The game ends when you click on a card with the
          number 99, which is the final target number. At this point, the
          stopwatch will stop counting, and a message will appear on the screen
          congratulating you for completing the game.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Reset the Game: After completing the game, the game will reset, and
          you can start a new game by clicking on the "INICIAR" button again.
        </li>
      </ol>
